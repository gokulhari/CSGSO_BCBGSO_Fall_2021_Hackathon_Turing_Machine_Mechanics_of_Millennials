# Yash scored 40 marks in a test, getting 3 marks for each right answer and losing 1
# mark for each wrong answer. Had 4 marks been awarded for each correct answer
# and 2 marks been deducted for each incorrect answer, then Yash would have
# scored 50 marks. How many questions were there in the test?
#
# questions?
# right + wrong = questions
# marks * right = 
# Restating in simple words:
#
# If each rightanswer gets 3 points, and each wrong answer gets -1 points then yash's total marks is 40
# If each rightanswer gets 4 points, and each wrong answer gets -2 points then yash's total marks is 50
#   
# 3x -  y = 40
# 4x - 2y = 50
#
# TotalYashMarks = 40
# 3 rightAnswer - wrongAnswer = TotalYashMarks

# Places A and B are 100 km apart on a highway. One car starts from A and another
# from B at the same time. If the cars travel in the same direction at different speeds,
# they meet in 5 hours. If they travel towards each other, they meet in 1 hour. What
# are the speeds of the two cars?
# 
# Let speeds be v1, v2;
